Using Large Language Models for Resolving Merge Conflicts in Pull Requests

# conflicts-solver-dataset
Inside `conflicts-crawler`, you'll discover a crawler that leverages the `On the Nature of Software Merge Conflicts` database (available at https://merge-nature.netlify.app/) to identify conflicts between files and to get those files.

It then engages the LLM to resolve these conflicts automatically.


# conflict-solver-custom
Inside `conflicts-solver`, you'll find a custom dataset built to study the behavior of LLMs when trying to solve different kinds of merge conflicts.
