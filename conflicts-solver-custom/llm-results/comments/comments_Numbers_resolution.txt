Result for Numbers:
public class Numbers {
    // Print numbers from 0 to 10
    public void printNumbers() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}


I will give you two Java files that have a merge conflict and I want you to give me a resolution file with the solution of the conflict between them using Java.
